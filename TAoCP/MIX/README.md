# Bargain Bin MIX emulator / interpreter

This is a very simple interpreter and emulator for MIX assembly language, as defined and used in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.

By both design and inexperience this program is very pedantic and ill-optimized. It is intended to be transparent and quick to debug. People who want something usable and reliable should use the [GNU MIX Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_MIX_Development_Kit).

That said: the MIX programs you will actually write in TAoCP are not arduous for modern CPUs.

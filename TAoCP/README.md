# The Art of Computer Programming - Notes, solutions, MIXAL interpreter

My personal notes and solutions to exercises (written in LaTeX) and a MIX emulator / MIXAL interpreter (written in C). Obviously a work in progress.

None of this stuff is guaranteed to be correct or even work. Sometimes solutions are sketched out and may be incorrect. You should definitely use the solutions from the back of the book instead of these!

*NOTE* The C MIXAL interpreter is very likely unsafe, and poorly optimized by design (it's very "pedantic"). It should not be used by folks who need a reliable MIX environment. Instead I strongly encouraged looking at the [GNU MDK](https://www.gnu.org/software/mdk/).

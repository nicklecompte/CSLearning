# Cleanup old binaries if they exist

# Build everything

# Check command line args for (or otherwise ask for) a
# 1) small file (< 5mb)
# 2) medium file (100-500mb)
# 3) very large file (> 2gb)

# We will be using assembler instructions to build a more appropriate stopwatch 
# later, but for now the Powershell one works.
